# Math311_Linear_Algebra_Projects

This is a repository for the Math 311 Linear Algebra course at Winona State University. It uses Google Colab and coding in Python to explore linear algebra concepts.

# Projects

1. Solving Systems using Colab and Python.

Used Google Co-laboratory to introduce the idea of solving systems of equations using code.

2. Predicted where skiers are going at a ski hill using a transition matrix.

Used Google Co-laboratory to perform calculations. Created a transition matrix and used the idea of Markov Chains to perform predictions.

3. Created the rankings of different NFL teams using the method of Best fit.

Used Google Co-laboratory to perform calculations. Ranked the NFC North and NFC East teams. The purpose was to predict who would win the Monday Night Football matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and Minnesota Vikings.

4. Found ortho-normalized vectors using the Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization Process.

Used google Co-laboratory to perform calculations. Wrote the code that changed random vectors into orthonormal vectors. The purpose was to create an orthonormal basis.
